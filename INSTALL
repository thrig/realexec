pretty manual and not much tested

    set ext [info sharedlibextension]
    exec make realexec$ext
    set dest [file normalize ~/lib/tcl/realexec/librealexec$ext]
    set ddir [file dirname $dest]
    file mkdir $ddir
    file copy -force pkgIndex.tcl $ddir
    file copy -force realexec$ext $dest

and then ensure that ~/.tclshrc knows about that directory

    set auto_path [linsert $auto_path 0 ~/lib/tcl]

it kinda sorta works on OpenBSD and also Mac OS X 10.11 (no my 2009
macbook hasn't died yet, thanks for asking). YMMV
